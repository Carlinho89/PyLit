Installation
============

Put ``pylit.py`` in any location you prefer. I recommend a place in Python's
`Module Search Path`_.


On Unix systems, easier invocation is possible if you put ``pylit.py`` (or a
link to it) in your PATH and make it executable or add an alias to your
shell configuration.
   
Alternatively, put `pylit.py` in the `Module Search Path`_ and put in the
PATH a small executable script, pylit_:

  .. include:: pylit
     :literal:

This has the advantage, that Python can compile ``pylit.py`` to byte-code
for faster execution with subsequent calls.

.. _module search path:

.. _pylit: pylit
