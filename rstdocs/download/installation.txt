Installation
============

1. Put ``simplestates.py`` in your Python `Module Search Path`__

2. Put ``pylit.py`` in any location you prefer (e.g. in the Module Search Path
   as well).

On Unix systems, easier invocation is possible if you put ``pylit.py`` (or a
link to it) in your PATH and make it executable or add an alias to your
shell configuration.
   
Alternatively, put `pylit.py` in the `Module Search Path` and put in the
PATH a small executable script, pylit_::

  #!/usr/bin/env python
  
  # call the pylit.py text <--> code converter
  import pylit
  pylit.main()

This has the advantage, that Python can preparse ``pylit.py`` for faster
execution on subsequent calls.
